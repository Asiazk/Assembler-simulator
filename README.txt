Final project in C programming course: Conversion of Assembly input files into binary code: replacing macros, planning memory allocation, and creating output files with special characters in 32-base format.

3 pass assembler simulator in C.
Pre-assembler: Reading .am file with Assembly commands, replacing macros and creating .as file.
First pass: Counting lines for binary encoding and creating label table.
Second pass: Binary encoding and creating .ob/.ent/.ext files with encoding from binary base to 32 base with special symbols.
