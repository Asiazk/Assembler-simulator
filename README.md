# Assembler-simulator
Final project in C programming course

3 pass assembler simulator in C.
Pre-assembler: Reading .am file with Assembly commands, replacing macros and creating .as file.
First pass: Counting lines for binary encoding and creating label table.
Second pass: Binary encoding and creating .ob/.ent/.ext files with encoding from binary base to 32 base with special symbols.

âœ¯assembler: Main program
preAssembler: Macros
firstPass: Label table and binary line counting
secondPass: Binary base and 32 base encoding
stringUtils: String handling functions
numUtils: Conversions of binary base and 32 base
utils: General functions
globals: Definition of constants and typedef
